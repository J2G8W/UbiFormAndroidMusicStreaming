# UbiForm Android Music Streaming App
> This is an Android app which is part of the demonstrations of the [UbiForm platform](https://github.com/J2G8W/UbiForm).


The repository gives an Android runnable app which presents the ability to stream files from the Android device to other components on the network.
It presents very simple functionality - add resource discovery hub and select file to make available for stream.
It works in conjunction with the music streaming example in the UbiForm examples folder.
It is a part of my PartII Computer Science project at the University of Cambridge.

## Installation
Add the UbiForm library to the path app/libs/UbiForm (can be done with a soft link if UbiForm already exists elsewhere on the system)

Android:
Use Android Studio with CMake to build the project.
